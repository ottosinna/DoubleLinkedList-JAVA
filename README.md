The provided code defines a generic doubly linked list data structure. The Node class represents a single node containing data of type T and references to the next and previous nodes. The DoubleLinkedListInterface specifies the methods required for managing the linked list, such as inserting, removing, and traversing elements. The DoubleLinkedList class implements this interface, providing the actual implementation of the doubly linked list. It maintains references to the start and end nodes, as well as the size of the list. The class includes methods for inserting elements at the start, end, or a specific position, removing elements from a specific position, getting the size, checking if the list is empty, and printing the list. The time complexity of each operation is documented in the code comments. The Book class is a simple example implementation of the Comparable interface, used to demonstrate how objects can be stored and sorted in the linked list based on their ISBN numbers.
